## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Characters with the slash symbols are used to indicate the type of parameter supplied by user.
  <br> eg. in `addm n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `n/` and `p/` are the symbols used before entering a parameter
  for `NAME` and `PHONE_NUMBER` respectively.
  
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `findm KEYWORD`, `KEYWORD` is a parameter which can be used as `findm Ben`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER [d/DAYS]` can be used as `n/Ben p/91111111 d/Mon` or as `n/John p/91111111`.
  
* Items with …​ after them can be used any number of times, including zero.
  e.g `setm INDEX d/DAY [d/DAY]…​` can be used as `setm 3 d/Mon`, `setm 3 d/Mon d/Tue`, etc.
  
* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME l/LOCATION`, `l/LOCATION n/NAME` is also acceptable.
  
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `listf`, `clearm` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
